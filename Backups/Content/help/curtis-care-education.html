		<h4>Upgrade your Bullard Eclipse LD Battery</h4>
		<p>Bullard has made enhancements to the Eclipse LD battery LED indicator function
			to more appropriately show battery depletion. For current Eclipse LD users, this
			update can be made via myBullard® in the form of a normal software load. The
			process is identical to loading new features and will take less than one minute
			to complete for each thermal imager.
			<a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">Contact us</a>
			for instructions on how to perform
			the upgrade through myBullard®.

		<h4>Personal Safety for Firefighters</h4>
		<p>The Firefighter Cancer Support Network (FCSN) developed a white paper documenting
			cancer in the fire service and published "What Immediate Actions Can I Take To Protect
			Myself". We thought it an important part of firefighters' personal approach to
			safety and have provided a link

			</a>
			for easy reference. We hope you find these eleven
			points useful and can easily employ them in your daily activities. Keep safe!
