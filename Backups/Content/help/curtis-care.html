<p>We use, sell and service the OHD Quantifit! This respirator fit tester is a revolutionary system that includes a patented fit testing
	technique known as controlled negative pressure (CNP). The test results are more reliable than those obtained with any other method of fit
	testing currently available, including qualitative methods and particle counting devices. Some valuable features of the Quantifit:
	pre-programmed exercise and test protocols that meet OSHA standards, easy-to conduct tests, speed fit factor calculations and no messy
	challenge agents or alcohol.</p>
